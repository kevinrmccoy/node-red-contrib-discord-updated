# Changelog\

## 4.3.4

### Features
- `discordMessageManager` and `discordReactionManager`: when `msg.channel` is not set, both nodes now fall back to `msg.message.channelId` to resolve the channel automatically.
- `discordReactionManager`: `collect` and `remove` event messages now include `msg.channel`, matching the existing behavior of `start` and `end` messages.

## 4.3.3

### Features
- `discordReactionManager`: the `collected` property on `end` messages is now an object mapping each emoji name to its reaction count (e.g. `{ "👍": 5, "👎": 2 }`) instead of a plain count.

## 4.3.2

### Features
- `discordReactionManager`: emits lifecycle messages — `type: "start"` when a collector starts and `type: "end"` (with reason `"timeout"` or `"commanded"`) when it stops, including the collected reaction count. Both lifecycle messages echo `message` and `channel` from the input so the output can be piped back to restart a collector.

## 4.3.1

### Features
- `discordReactionManager`: added `msg.stop` support. Send `msg.stop = true` with `msg.message` to stop listening for reactions on a specific message immediately, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

## 4.3.0

### Features
- Added `discordVoiceState` node UI template and `GuildVoiceStates` gateway intent so voice state events work out of the box.

## 4.1.0

### Breaking Changes
- Raised the minimum Node.js version to 20 and refreshed core dependencies (`discord.js` 14.15.3, `node-red` 4.0.x, mocha/sinon, flatted) to match the new baseline.

### Features
- Added entity select menu support (user, role, mentionable, channel) across interaction nodes and component formatting.
- Extended the command manager to accept `nameLocalizations` / `descriptionLocalizations` (and nested equivalents) and forward them to Discord automatically.
- Hardened scheduled event handling with stage-channel validation and clearer errors when the channel type is incorrect.
- Added message flag controls (`suppressEmbeds`, `suppressNotifications`) to the message and interaction manager nodes.
- Introduced bulk message `bulkDelete` / `bulkFetch` actions with age/pin/author filters plus safety confirmations.
- Added dedicated nodes for guild emoji management (`discordEmojiManager`), role membership queries (`discordRoleManager`), and voice-state events (`discordVoiceState`).
- Delivered per-message attachment metadata (description, spoiler, duration) through the formatter and response nodes.
- Expanded interaction tooling to cover ephemeral replies, follow-up creation, edits, and deletions.

### Enhancements & UX
- Enabled the permissions node to fetch role members via `roleQuery` lookups without swapping nodes mid-flow.
- Refreshed palette organisation and icons so listen/respond/manage/advanced nodes are visually distinct in the Node-RED editor.
- Reworked the `discordClient` node to hand out lightweight tokens (`msg.discord.get()/drop()`, `msg.discordClient`) instead of the raw client, prevent overwrites, and clean up handles automatically.
- Validated attachments/components against the latest discord.js builders with improved error reporting.

### Fixes
- Replaced the global BigInt JSON patch with a scoped helper (`discord/lib/json-utils.js`) and migrated every caller for safe cloning.
- Swapped the interaction cache to an auto-evicting `Map` to avoid memory leaks across deployments.
- Stopped `discord/lib/discordFramework.js` from leaking implicit globals when resolving scheduled event managers.
- Guaranteed application ID resolution in the command manager, improved handling of void REST responses, and surfaced richer errors via Node-RED status/error APIs.
- Audited message/event/permissions/channel-name/member/typing/activity/client nodes to follow Node-RED async best practices (`send/done`, status updates, credential safety) with clearer errors.
- Added `node-red.version` (>=4.0.0) to `package.json` so the Flow Library scorecard recognises supported Node-RED versions.
- Declared examples path in `package.json` and clarified import steps in README so examples are visible under Import → Examples.
- Updated README compatibility matrix and version banner.

### Documentation
- Updated the README/changelog to reflect the new project home (`chrobione/node-red-contrib-discord-updated`) and outline the Discord.js parity roadmap.
- Added onboarding quick-start guidance, palette grouping explanations, and clarified which manager owns Discord interaction replies.
- Rewrote every node help panel with clearer descriptions, inputs, and tips for new users.
- Added the `interactionFollowupLifecycle` example flow demonstrating ephemeral replies and follow-up management.
- Documented Node 20 requirements, snowflake/ID expectations, and other best-practice adjustments across README, help text, and examples.
- Ensured every node has an example flow and consolidated overlapping into two umbrella examples covering guild/admin and member/reaction/typing/voice/client nodes.

### Maintenance & Planning
- Preserved history from `node-red-contrib-discord` and `node-red-contrib-discord-advanced` while moving stewardship to the new repository.
- Kept `node-red-node-test-helper` at ^0.2.7 pending a 4.x compatible upstream release.
- Established the Phase 1 scope to stabilise the fork, acknowledge prior contributors, and chart upcoming Discord.js coverage.

### Tests
- Updated mocha specs to reflect the new error-handling pattern, attachment validation rules, and interaction tooling.

**Breaking changes!!**
This update brings Discord v13 to to this node. This also means node version 16.6 or higher is now required.

Other breaking changes:
* When sending embeds the msg.payload will stay the content of the messages. You supply the Embed Object through msg.embeds (or msg.embed) as a MessageEmbed object or an array of MessageEmbeds. This allows multiple embeds to be added to a message and also the abilty to set the content of the message which will be displayed seperately.

New features:
* msg.attachment or msg.attachments can now be an array of String which allows multiple attachments to be added.

## 2.3.2

Added msg.request as an output to discordMessageManager. This will output the original input msg.
## 2.3.1

Bugfix: code would ignore msg.attachment when the message to be sent was an embed.
## 2.3.0

discordMessageManager now has an ouput that passes the Object of the message that was created, edited or deleted.

## 2.2.0

Added the ability to send and edit embed messages with discordMessageManager.
## 2.1.0

* Add the discordPermissions node which allows checking of roles a specific user has in a guild.
## 2.0.2

* Hotfix for error handling when msg.message isn't supplied.
## 2.0.1

* Hotfix for message sending not working when supplying an object for msg.channel or msg.user
## 2.0.0
**Breaking changes!!**
The discordSendMessage and discordDeleteMessage nodes have been removed and its functionality moved into the discordMessageManager.
To edit or delete messages you now need to send msg.action with either 'edit' or 'delete' to the discordMessageManager.
Also to edit or delete messages the variable for the message object or ID is now called msg.message for more clarity.

I know these changes make a lot of difference for flow's but this change will mean new functionality's won't require breaking changes. 
These should be the last breaking changes from my code, they could still happen if DiscordJS changes.

Other changes:
* Lots of code refactoring for a more robust code base.
* Better error messages when wrong data is supplied or there's problems in DiscordJS.

## 1.1.1

* Added Discord to the Readme.
* Updated description.
## 1.1

* Added ability to send private messages with discordSendMessage.

## 1.0.1

* Add the msg.memberRoleIDs output to the discordMessage node.
## 1.0.0

Initial publicly usable versions of `node-red-contrib-discord-advanced`.
This builds on [`node-red-contrib-discord`](https://github.com/jorisvddonk/node-red-contrib-discord).

**Breaking changes when updating from `node-red-contrib-discord`:**
The discordMessage node supplies the msg.data object. This is the full message object recieved from DiscordJS.
Since the API was updated this object has changed. To find out what data is now in the object see the [documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Message). The same goes for msg.member, see it's documentation [here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/GuildMember), and msg.author which you can find [here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/User).

Current additional features:
* Updated the code base to use DiscordJS V12.
* Added discordDeleteMessage with the ability to delete existing discord messages.
* Added ability to edit messages by providing a message id to the discordSendMessage node.
* Updated node documentation.
